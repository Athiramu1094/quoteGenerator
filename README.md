Quote Generator

. Implemented functionality to randomly select and display a quote from a predefined list of quotes.
  Ensured that each quote comes with its corresponding author.

. Created an array of objects, each containing a quote and its author.

. Initial attempts to access morningQuotes.quote directly resulted in an undefined error. Resolved by properly referencing the array element.

. Gained experience in writing functions that interact with array data.
